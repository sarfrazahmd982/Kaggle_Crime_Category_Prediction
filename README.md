# Crime_Category_Prediction

> This machine learning project involves predicting the category of crimes based on a detailed dataset of criminal incidents in a city. The data includes various       features like the incident location, date, time, victim demographics, and more.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of:

* train.csv: Training data with features and the target variable crime_category.

* test.csv: Test data containing similar features without the target variable.

## Key Columns:
> Location, Cross_Street, Latitude, Longitude: Geographic details of the incident.

> Date_Reported, Date_Occurred, Time_Occurred: Time-related information of the incident.

> Victim Details: Age, gender, and descent of the victim.

> Crime Details: Crime classification, modus operandi, weapon used, and case status.

> Crime_Category: The category of the crime (target variable).

## Results & Evaluation
The model performance will be evaluated based on accuracy and other classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Conclusion
This project aims to predict crime categories using machine learning to help improve crime prevention strategies and enhance public safety.
